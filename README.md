# Archipelago-Manual-WorldofWarcraft-Leveling
This AP World requires the use of the of World of Warcraft up to the Mists of Pandaria Expansion, as all the zones and content are defined as they were during those expansions.
I'll let you figure out how to play on those expansion on your own ;)

## Goals
* Either:
  * Level your character all the way up to maximum level depending on the expansion you have chosen (example: Mists of Pandaria = Level 90)
  * Find all the Gold items in the pool
## How to play
* Select which of the two faction you want to play in your YAML. This will give you the correct zones to level in
* Each Level Up will send 1 item from the pool
* You can only go past a certain level once you find the appropriate "Maximum Level" items
* You can only level up in the zones you have unlocked
* There are many options you can turn on in the YAML, including Talent Rows, "Hardcore", Dungeons, etc.
* Depending on the game client you are playing, you can also select if the zones in the pool are Pre or Post Cataclysm. This will affect the zones and the levels at which they are accessed.
